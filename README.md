# Feature Selection using Embedded Methods

Welcome to the repository on feature selection using embedded methods. In this repository, we explore various embedded methods 
for selecting the most relevant features in a dataset. Embedded methods optimize feature subsets based on the performance of a specific machine learning model.

## Introduction

Feature selection is a critical step in building machine learning models. It involves selecting a subset of relevant features from the 
original feature set, which can lead to improved model performance and reduced overfitting. Embedded methods are a category of feature 
selection techniques that evaluate feature subsets based on their impact on model performance while the model is being trained.

we explore two common embedded methods: Lasso Regression and Decision Trees. Each of these methods uses a different approach to 
select an optimal feature subset for a given machine learning model.

## Embedded Methods

### Lasso Regression

**Lasso Regression** is an embedded method that adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, encouraging feature sparsity. 
It automatically selects the most relevant features by setting some feature coefficients to zero.

### Decision Trees

**Decision Trees** can be used as an embedded method by evaluating feature importance during the tree-building process. Features that contribute the 
most to the tree's decision-making are considered the most relevant.

## Usage

To use these embedded methods for feature selection, you can refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. The notebook demonstrates how to apply Lasso Regression and Decision Trees for feature selection using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn.
